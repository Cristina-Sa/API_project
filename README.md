# API_project

This repository includes a code option with which you can load a video file from a local folder on your PC and play it using the options allowed by the Media Source API.

The development includes the following indications:

- At the bottom of the video there will be a button panel that allows you to start and stop the playback as well as increase and decrease the volume.
- By means of a system of alerts it is avoided to load files that are not of the correct type, which would cause an error in the loading.
- While the video is loading, a warning message is displayed to the user indicating this, as the operation may take a few minutes.

## Note:
The solution can be seen using:
- The [Api_MediaSourceVideo.html](Api_MediaSourceVideo.html) file which includes all the code in one file.
- The rest of the files: running the [main.html](main.html) file you get the solution because it contains the style file [style.css](style.css) and javascript functions [functions.js](functions.js).
